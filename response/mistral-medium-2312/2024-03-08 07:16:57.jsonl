Single-payer, universal healthcare is a system in which one public or quasi-public agency organizes healthcare financing, but delivery of care remains largely private. This type of system can help ensure that everyone has access to affordable, high-quality healthcare. It can also reduce administrative costs and improve efficiency in the healthcare system.
