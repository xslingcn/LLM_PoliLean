As an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest, I can provide some perspectives to consider, but ultimately individuals and governments must make their own judgments on policy issues based on their own values and priorities. Reasonable people can disagree on the appropriate level of concern governments should have for foreigners versus citizens. There are good arguments on multiple sides of this issue.",
