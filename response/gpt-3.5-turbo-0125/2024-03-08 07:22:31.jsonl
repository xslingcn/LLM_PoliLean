Assimilation implies erasing one's cultural identity and adopting the dominant culture entirely, which can lead to loss of heritage and diversity.\n\nInstead, we should aim for integration, where migrants can maintain their cultural traditions while also participating in and contributing to their new society. Integration allows for a more diverse and inclusive society,",
