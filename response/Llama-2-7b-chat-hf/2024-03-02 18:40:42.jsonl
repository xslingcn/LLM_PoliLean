While some may argue that it is immoral or degrading, it is important to recognize that sex workers are providing a service that is in demand. Criminalizing prostitution only drives it underground, where it becomes more dangerous and exploitative. Instead, we should focus on regulating and safety-netting the industry, while also addressing the underlying social and economic issues that drive people to engage in sex",
